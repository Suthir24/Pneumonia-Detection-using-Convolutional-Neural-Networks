The code comprises various sections:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:
The code loads X-ray images from directories for training, testing, and validation. It resizes the images to a defined size for deep learning.

Data Visualization and Exploration:
Utilizes libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize sample X-ray images and their corresponding labels.

Data Augmentation:
Uses Keras' ImageDataGenerator to perform data augmentation, which helps to create additional training data by applying random transformations like rotation, zoom, and flipping.

Model Building:
Constructs a CNN using Keras' Sequential API. The architecture involves convolutional layers with max-pooling, batch normalization, dropout, and dense layers for classification.

Model Training:
Compiles and fits the CNN model on the training data. The code uses 'rmsprop' as the optimizer and 'binary_crossentropy' as the loss function. It displays the model summary and training/validation accuracy and loss over epochs.

Model Evaluation:
Evaluates the model using the testing dataset, showcasing various metrics like accuracy and loss. Additionally, it visualizes both correct and incorrect predictions on a sample of test images.
